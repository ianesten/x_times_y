x_times_y.exe is a program that takes two command line arguments.
Argument 1 is x, and should be a number between 0 and 10 inclusive. It should
be passed as a string.
Argument 1 is y, and should be a number between 0 and 10 inclusive. It should
be passed as a string.
x_times_y is supposed to print x * y to stdout.

The task is to write a python script that calls x_times_y for all combinations
of x and y for 0 <= x,y <= 10. The python script should print a report on
combinations that failed. There are some subtle errors, so careful handling of
each case is needed! The script should also try intentionally incorrect inputs.
